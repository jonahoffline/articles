# Going back to MINSWAN roots

>*Hello darkness, my old friend. I've come to talk with you again,
because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
and the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence.* - Simon and Garfunkel (The sound of Silence)

The Internet is Hell; anarchy in flesh and blood. It's a love/hate relationship where there is no hope of escaping. It's also the garden of the fruit of knowledge.

As developers, we spend more time socializing over fiber-optic cables than our physical counterpart. We commit, push, pull, fork, merge and rebase code. We love to brag about code we write and make fun of what we don't. Everyday it is harder to keep up with new advances in technology. Most universities don't give a fuck about education so they steal time and money from those who think they're getting ready for the real world. Computer Science degrees are a joke. Most professors are stuck with their ancient knowledge and bitter charm.

It's our duty as developers to help future generations transition and transfer our experience and knowledge. Help guide new developers through the correct path. There are so many great languages, tools and practices to just limit ourselves with whatever they're getting paid to teach.
